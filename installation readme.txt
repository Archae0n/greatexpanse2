1. Unzip the mod contents (including the folder containing this file) inside 'documents/paradox interactive/stellaris/mod'
2. Cut and Paste the greatexpanse.mod file up one directory (same location as the folder)
3. Deselect all other mods and run this alone and/or with Music mods only.
4. If you somehow fuck it up, ping @Archaeon#0420 on Discord for help
